# Analyzing-Large-Data-in-R

The goal of this project is to analyze a large data set (i.e., larger than the current memory capacity) with the help of SQL database system. The data consists of flight arrival and departure details for all commercial flights within the USA, from October 1987 to April 2008. This is a large dataset: there are nearly 120 million records in total, and takes up 1.6 gigabytes of space compressed and 12 gigabytes when uncompressed. The challenge for this project is to provide a graphical summary of important features of the data set.
